# Dashboard using Fifa 2017
This is a project for learning how to make dashboards in python using dash and plotly.
The code is largely based on the examples found on the Dash webpage (https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started)

The dataset was made available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/artimous/complete-fifa-2017-player-dataset-global).
